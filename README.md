# modflex
A demonstration of congruence classes

Built with theoretical applications in mind, modflex defines a collection of strict intensional functions derived intuitively from the axiomatic definition of modulo. Being modular, they rely on a prescribed base number. The base number is conventionally prime.

The identity functions of this class serve as proofs a priori, and they imply a much deeper relationship between the given groups. Because every function is bijective, it is a coherent basis for more accurately describing congruence classes.
